There are a _lot of AWS services_, and while studying for the _AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-03)_ exam, it felt like there was a new service every question.

Below are visualizations of the main AWS services covered in the exam, grouped by capability.
If you are studying for your exam, be sure to **_understand the distinction between all the services available in each group_**.
Most questions within the exam will have you _choosing between the services in each grouping_ based on the specific scenario.

_Please note: Lines drawn between services are **not exhaustive**, but usually indicates the service **only works with the services pointed at** (in that category)._

## Compute Solutions
Compute solutions are a large portion of the exam, I'd recommend understanding _**EC2 instances** and **Lambda functions**_ particularly well as these are covered extensively.

Some specific topics I found useful studying for include:
- Difference between _**EC2 launch types** eg. on-demand, reserved and spot instances_
- _**EC2 placement groups** eg. cluster, partition and spread placements_
- _**Lambda execution** and **resource limits**_
- When to use _**AWS Batch** over **Lambda** or **auto-scaling EC2 instances**_

## Security Services
For security services, having a strong understanding of _**IAM roles and policies** and **security groups vs. network ACLs**_ would be very beneficial.
In my experience there were a lot of _**multi-account context** questions_ relating to _**resource access between accounts** and **ways to manage configuration/compliance across accounts**._

Some specific details I found helpful to learn include:
- Understanding _**IAM groups, roles and policies**, especially in a multi-account context_
- When to use _**AWS Shield, AWS WAF** and the **Network Firewall**_
- When to use _**Secrets Manager**, **Key Management Service (KMS)** and **Parameter Store**_ 
- Difference in encryption options between _**KMS, HSM and S3 encryption**_

## Storage Services
A strong understanding in _**S3 and different database options**_ are required for this section.
I personally also found multiple questions asking _which data migration services to use_ and _which hybrid file systems best suit the situation._

I'd recommend ensuring you've studied the topics below before the exam:
- _**S3 storage classes, versioning, object-locking and cross-region replication**_
- _**Amazon EBS volume types** and when to use them_
- **Most database questions** can be answered by _narrowing the options in databases between_:
    - SQL vs. NoSQL
    - OLTP vs. OLAP
    - Multi-AZ support vs. Cross-Region support
    - Managed vs. Serverless
- _**Difference between data migration services and hybrid cloud options** eg. DataSync, Snow family and Storage Gateway_

## Networking Services
For networking services, I would focus on the _interactions between **CloudFront and S3**, and the differences between **Direct Connection, VPC Peering and Transit Gateway.**_

Some particular points to focus in this section are:
- Difference between _**security groups** vs. **network ACLs** and when to use them_
- How _**CloudFront and S3** work together to restrict access to user groups eg. signed cookies and pre-signed urls_
- When to use _**Direct Connection vs. VPNs vs. Private Links**_
- What **Transit Gateway** solves when using **VPC peering**

## Application Integration
Most questions in this section revolve around _**connecting distributed systems**_ and the specifics around _**EventBridge, SQS, SNS and API Gateway.**_
I'd look to specifically understand:

- The difference between _**SQS and FIFO SQS** and their default limits eg. max queue lifetime and max throughput_
- How _**EventBridge, SQS, SNS** fit in with common event-driven architectures eg. fan-in/fan-out and linking event listeners to SNS for distribution_

## Management Services
There is a broad set of management services which can appear as part of a bigger question. 
Having a basic understand of each service, especially _**Cloud Trail, Cloud Watch, Savings Plans, Systems Manager, Cloud Formation and Organizations**_ would be useful in tackling the most common ones. 

- When to use _**Cloud Trail** vs. **Cloud Watch** and their tangential services eg. cloud trail events, cloud watch agents_
- How **Organizations** and **Control Tower** help manage and their role in migrating AWS accounts and organisations
- The different types of _**Savings Plans** offered_
- Ability to read and understand basic **Cloud Formation** templates

### Machine Learning Services
These topics are not as important, I found that we only really need to know _what each service does at a very surface level._ 
I'd recommend focusing in other areas and just memorizing the name of each service and what they do.

See image below.
