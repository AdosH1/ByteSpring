Hashmaps are one of the most common and useful data structures that power the internet, and for good reason. 
It is used heavily used in data caching, file systems and general algorithms but not many people know how one is built.

In this issue, we will run over the _**characteristics of a hashmap**, **what hashing functions are** and **how we can build very our own hashmap**._

## Characteristics of a Hashmap

Hashmaps give access to key-value style storage while maintaining exceptional performance retrieving and entering data.
It can hold pretty much any data as a key or value (include nulls) and work well with many basic operations like keeping count or aggregating distinct elements due to its low operational time complexity. 

The drawback with hashmaps is that they use more memory than other data structures,
elements are not guaranteed to be ordered and that it is not thread-safe by default, which can cause issues due to corruption and undefined behaviour. 

However given how many problem contexts mitigate its drawbacks, hashmaps have become a staple data structure with pretty _minimal trade-offs._

### Obtaining O(1) Access

If you read our article on [A Fundamental Look on Data Structures](/posts/fundamental-look-data-structures), you’ll know that theres only 2 underlying data structures we can use to develop a hashmap, an array and a linked list.

To provide O(1) access to elements, we'll have to use an array.
When we compare how a hashmap functions to an array, we can see they are actually quite similar.

The _**index**_ of the array has been replaced by a _**key** that could be potentially any object_, but otherwise the rest of the data structure is _(almost)_ the same .

## Hashing Functions - Converting Objects to Numbers
If we can somehow produce a unique number from an object, then we can use that number as the index for an array. 
These are known as _**hashing functions**_, and theres an infinite way of implementing them. 

<img src="/create-a-hashmap/object-hash-number.png" width="718" height="404" alt="An object passing through a hashing function" style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

An example _hashing function for a string_ would be to convert all letters into their numbers by order of appearance in the alphabet, then adding them together.

<img src="/create-a-hashmap/hashmap-under-hood.png" width="718" height="404" alt="Shows an string key converted into a number but adding the letters together" style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

A _**good hashing function**_ would _maximize the variance of input to output_, where small changes in the data cause large differences in the hash. 
The idea here is to spread data as equally as possible along all possible positions in the array.

#### A minor problem
If we used our example string hash, we would need to reserve a large amount of memory pre-allocating an array that can handle large hashes.
Given _any length of array_, there will always be the possiblity that someone uses a string thats a little bit longer than we designed for.

One way we can solve this issue is to bind the hash to a given size by using the _**modulo operation**_ on the hash.
This will clamp any number into the range from _0 to just under your modulo amount._

<img src="/create-a-hashmap/supercali.png" width="718" height="404" alt="Shows how the modulo operator can conform index to a limit" style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

And voila, we've found a way to _**convert string keys into array indices**._ 
This kind of process can be implemented for all types of objects, but is beyond the scope of this article. 
For simplicity’s sake, many languages have their own hashcode function already implemented for most objects, 
so we can use that in our implementation instead.

### Handling Collisions

What happens if two indexes are calculated at the same value? Most hashing functions are pretty good at giving unique values, but it is not foolproof.

For example, using our string hashing function on the words _**race**_ and _**care**_ will result in the same hash!
This is an unfortunate reality that we have to handle.

<img src="/create-a-hashmap/collision.png" width="718" height="404" alt="Two words, race and care have the same hash value using our old hashing function" style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

The solution is a trade-off, instead of storing the raw value in our array, we can store a _(linked)_ list of elements in any single index.
This way, we can append each collision we find into the list.

This makes our getting and setting logic a bit more difficult, 
as we'll have to search through the list to find the _**matching key and value**_.
_Note: A colliding key will have the same hash, so we'll have to also check against the raw query key in order to retrieve the right element_

<img src="/create-a-hashmap/LL-hashmap.png" width="718" height="404" alt="A hashmap built with an array of linked lists" style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

Collisions _technically_ break our O(1) access to elements however, the longer the array is the less likely we are to collide and preserve our hashmap performance. 
The trade-off is that in the unlikely case there are collisions, we’ll be able to retrieve multiple values on the same index due to the linked list structure.

## Creating Our Own Hashmap
So now that we know the theory to implementing a hashmap, how would our class look like?
Here is an example in Kotlin, though any language will suffice.

<img src="/create-a-hashmap/code-hashmap-class.png" width="718" height="404" alt="An example class of a hashmap" style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

Let's go over line by line:
- (L1) Our hashmap is implemented over a _generic **K** and **V**_, which will allow us to store any key or value as its inputs. 
- (L2) A _**DEFAULT_MAX_SIZE**_ must be defined to pre-allocate memory for our underlying array
- (L3) We define the bulk of our new data structure - _an array holding a linked list!_
- (L5-6) These are the main functions we have to interact with our hashmap, the _**operator**_ functions allows us to use the syntax _hashmap[key] = value_
- (L8-10) My implementation of a linked list, though your language's native linked list will work as long as the internal object contains _both **key** and **value**_ information inside

To implement our _**get function**_, we'll need to find the index in our array, then traverse down the linked list for the element.

<img src="/create-a-hashmap/code-hashmap-get.png" width="718" height="404" alt="Example implementation of get method in kotlin" style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

Reading through line by line:
- (L4) Notice we're returning a _nullable V?_ This operation can fail and return null
- (L5) Here we call our hash function which will return an Int clamped to the range of our array
- (L6) This line extracts the linked list object at the index of the array
- (L7) We call a helper function to traverse the linked list, matching our query key to the key stored in the list. We return the value once a match is found.

Perhaps you can complete the _**helper function** and **set method**_ on your own?
Try explore your own solutions and let me know how you go!

Once the **get** and **set** methods are implemented, this would suffice as a minimum viable hashmap that we can use to store data.
Later on, you may want to be able to **clear**, **get all keys** or add **your own custom functionality** to your hashmap. 

I'll leave that to you to explore, happy coding out there!
