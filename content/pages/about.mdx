I currently work as a Software Engineer at Virtual Gaming Worlds (VGW), working on E2E testing and distributed systems.
I've spent 2 years at Rio Tinto facilitating backend monitoring and communication tools for mining,
and before that, in 3D point cloud visualization modelling wear patterns in grinding/crushing equipment.

I dabble in Kotlin, C#, F#, Typescript and Rust. I&apos;m passionate about most software engineering topics, and if you have a software programming hot take, I want to hear it.
