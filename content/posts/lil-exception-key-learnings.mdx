Exceptions handle programming logic in cases where they cannot be resolved at that level of abstraction.
They can be used in different ways, but most commonly they are used as **_error handlers_** and for **_control flow_**.

However, we've been taught that we should minimize the use of exceptions, as _exceptions have a cost associated with them_, but just **_how costly are exceptions really?_**

[Aleksey Shipil—ëv](https://twitter.com/shipilev) wrote an [article](https://shipilev.net/blog/2014/exceptional-performance/) micro-benchmarking exception handling in Java on the JVM.
Below we'll take a look at the key learnings from the article to understand how we can go about using and managing exceptions with regards to application performance.

## Exception Instantiation
Exceptions have two main costs, **exception instantiation** and **stack unwinding**.

_Instantiation_ is the creation of the exception object. This is more costly than creating a regular object as it also has to _**fill in a stacktrace** with the current application's state._ 
Below is the time cost of returning a value vs. raising exceptions.

From the graph above we can see that **_filling in the stacktrace costs the most_**, as just _instantiating the exception (without stacktrace) takes a fraction of the time._
_Note: There's a cost to actually **using** the stacktrace as well, as the machine must convert its native stacktrace to a Java stacktrace. This costs another order of magnitude of time to complete._

### The Effect of Stack Depth
The depth at which an exception is thrown also affects its performance. 
This makes sense as **_the longer the stack, the more you need to write into the exception object._**

The previous graph assumed the developer was immediately throwing from the main function. In a more realistic scenario, the developer would probably have layers of domain logic and application framework logic in the stack to crawl through.

<Image src="/lilexception/exception-instantiation-stack-depth.png" width="718" height="404" alt="A graph showing the growing cost of exception creation based on stack depth." />

Here we can see a linear relationship between **stack depth** and **exception instantiation time**. 

As a quick gauge, creating a basic webapi using Ktor and raising an exception at the database level is _around 100 stacks deep._
This lands us around 9 microseconds per exception, potentially being worse for more complex applications or using more costly frameworks such as Spring.

## Stack Unwinding
Stack unwinding is the process by which if an exception can't be handled, _control is handed to the functions caller._
This wasn't covered in much depth, but we can see the cost is _proportionally much smaller than the cost of creating the exception._

<Image src="/lilexception/exception-instantiation-cost-difference.png" width="718" height="404" alt="A graph showing the time cost of returning a value, exception without stacktrace and an exception with stacktrace. An arrow points at the large difference between the exception without stacktrace and with stacktrace." />

### The Effect of JVM Optimizations
From the tests, there seems to be a relationship between the **_distance between the throw and the catch_**. 
This makes sense, as there is a cost to _relieving control to a function caller_ and the further away the handler is the more this costs.

Unfortunately, the JVM provides non-deterministic optimizations at runtime, making the measuring of a stack unwind quite difficult.
Below is a graph of exception unwind time while manually overriding the JVM's in-line optimizations. 

<Image src="/lilexception/exception-stack-unwinding.png" width="718" height="404" alt="A graph plotting the relationship between exception throw time and number of lines inlined by the JVM." />

Here we can see that with enough in-lining, there's _effectively no cost to exception handling_ as the logic branch is **_copied directly into machine code._**
Its also noteworthy to see that one handover to a function caller _costs around 230 nanoseconds_ when it does not get in-lined.

Unfortunately, it appears we're at the _mercy of the JVM_ when it comes to optimizing stack unwinding, as we cannot control the optimizations done by the JVM at runtime.

## Exceptional Frequency

So far, we've been assuming that there is an exception to be handled, but realistically we'd only hit these every so often.

To create a more realistic scenario, we can hammer the test with _1 million calls and vary the number of exceptions thrown within those million._

<Image src="/lilexception/exception-frequency.png" width="718" height="404" alt="A graph plotting frequency of exceptions per million of function calls against time." />

In this graph, we can take note of 3 lines:
- **Dynamic:** Throw at bottom leaf, catch at root _(NB: yellow line is hidden behind the blue line)_
- **Dynamic (chained):** Throw at bottom leaf, catch, rewrap and rethrow at each step _(NB: stack is 20 deep in this example)_
- **Flags:** Returns int error code _(error will be checked at each leaf)_

This graph shows that **_errors codes offer quite consistent performance_** at high and low exception frequencies whereas **_throwing exceptions start well but gets worse_** as the frequency hits 100s - 1000s of exceptions per million function calls.

Zooming in, there are actually some interesting details in the data.

<Image src="/lilexception/exception-frequency-zoomed.png" width="718" height="404" alt="A graph plotting frequency of exceptions per million of function calls against time, zoomed in to show better performance for exceptions at low frequency." />

Dynamic exceptions _(yellow line)_ would be the closest to ordinary error handling, and we can see it actually **_performs better than error codes_** at low exception frequencies.
The cross-over point appears to be around the _1000s of exceptions per million calls._

This is interesting, because although **_error codes provide consistent performance_**, there is still an **_overhead to checking whether there is an error_** at each step.
Throwing exceptions however, **_do not need to worry about the unhappy path until it happens_** - saving execution cycles at low frequencies.

## Takeaways

So should we use exceptions or not? _It depends._
For the vast majority of cases, use the style that makes the most sense for your team.
_You probably don't need to think about any of this_ unless you're actually having performance issues.

It is interesting to note that using result type handling will provide **_more consistent performance_** whereas exceptions are **_great when they're truly exceptional._** 

#### Exceptions for Control Flow Optimization
One interesting thing this article revealed is that in Java/Kotlin, you're able to manually override and disable the filling of the stacktrace in your exceptions.
```kotlin
// this function is overridable to do nothing!
throwable.fillInStackTrace() 
```

Disabling stacktrace on control flow exceptions _(and leaving the **real errors**)_ could reduce the normal cost of exception handling by **~96%**!
