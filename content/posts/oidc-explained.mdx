Open Identity Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol built on top of OAuth.
It allows resource owners to verify the identity of an end-user and obtain basic information about them.

OAuth does not specify a way for servers to authenticate, but rather assumes all parties are already trusted.
In a practical sense, without authentication, this makes OAuth unusable on the web unless paired with a separate authentication protocol, 
that is what OpenID Connect is.
Where OAuth is concerned about authorization, OIDC is concerned with authentication.  
If you'd like to learn more about OAuth, see [OAuth Explained (simply)](./oauth-explained.mdx).

## How It Works
OIDC uses _**Identity Tokens**_ to communicate claims about an end-user's identity and their basic user data (depending on implementation).
A given a minimal set of claims, it contains no details about the user but demonstrates that the user was authenticated by a trusted entity, and thus trust the claims about their identity.

Besides being an critical step to accessing resources, 
identity tokens are commonly used to personalise the user experience by recognising their preferences, 
displaying information based on user status or country etc.


## OpenID Connect Authentication Flow
OAuth authorization servers implementing OIDC are referred to as OpenID Providers (OPs) & resource servers are referred to as Relying Parties (RPs)
The authentication flow looks like this:

1. The Relying Party sends a request to the OpenID Provider
2. OP authenticates the End-User and obtains authorization
3. OP responds with an ID Token and usually an Access Token (OAuth)
    - At this point, the application may have all the data it needs from the claims
4. RP can further request with the Identity Token to a UserInfo endpoint
5. The UserInfo endpoint returns claims about the end-user

This flow might look very similar to the OAuth flow, which is on purpose.
OIDC is build on top of OAuth, providing almost the same workflow but with authentication built in. 

## Identity Tokens
Identity tokens are security tokens that contain claims about:
- How a user was authenticated
- Basic details about the end user
- Any other claims you wish to add (it will be ignored at the protocol level)
