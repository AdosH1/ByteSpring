title: AWS Solutions Architect Associate Services Visualised
description: A visualisation of the services provided by AWS for the solutions architect associate exam (SAA-03)

There are a _lot of AWS services_, and while studying for the _AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-03)_ exam, it felt like there was a new service every question.

Below are visualizations the main AWS services covered in the exam, grouped by business capability (not exhaustive).
If you are studying for your exam, be sure to **_understand the distinction between all the services available in each group_**.
Most questions within the exam will have you _choosing between the services in each grouping_ based on the specific scenario.

_Please note: the lines below are not exhaustive, but usually indicates the service **only** works with the services pointed at_

## Compute Solutions
For compute solutions, I'd recommend understanding _**EC2 instances** and **Lambda functions**_ well.
In particular, I found it helpful to understand:
- Difference between EC2 launch types eg. on-demand, reserved and spot
- EC2 placement groups eg. cluster, partition and spread
- Lambda execution and resource limits
- When to use AWS Batch over Lambda or autoscaling EC2 instances

## Security Services
For security services, having a strong understanding of _**IAM roles and policies** and **security groups and network ACLs**_ would be very beneficial.
In my experience there were a lot of multi-account context questions relating to _access between accounts_ and _how we would manage resources under different organizational units (OUs)._

Some specific details I found helpful include:
- Understanding IAM groups, roles and policies, especially in a multi-account context
- When to use AWS Shield, AWS WAF and the Network Firewall
- Difference between security groups and network ACLs and when to use them
- When to use Guard Duty and Inspector
- Difference between encrpytion options including KMS, HSM and S3 encryption options

## Storage Services
A strong understanding in _**S3 and different database options**_ are required for this section.
I personally found multiple questions related to setting data migrations and setting up hybrid file systems.

I'd recommend at the minimum understanding the below topics:
- S3 storage classes, versioning and cross-region replication
- Amazon EBS volume types and when to use them
- Database questions can be answered by narrowing the options in databases between:
    - SQL vs. NoSQL
    - OLTP vs. OLAP
    - Multi-AZ support vs. Cross-Region support
    - Managed vs. Serverless
- Difference between data migration services and hybrid cloud options eg. DataSync, Snow family and Storage Gateway

## Networking Services
For networking services, I would focus on the _**interactions between CloudFront and S3 and the differences between Direct Connections, VPC Peering and Transit Gateway.**__

Some particular points to focus in this section are:
- When to use network ACLs and security groups
- How CloudFront and S3 work together to restrict access to user groups eg. signed cookies and pre-signed urls
- When to use Direct Connection vs. VPNs vs. Private Links
- Difference between transit gateway and VPC peering

## Application Integration / Distributed Systems


---
## Account Management Services

---
### Machine Learning Services
These tops are not as important, we only really need to know at a very surface level what each service does.
