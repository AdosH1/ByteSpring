Data structures at their core are a way to store and manipulate data in a computer. It provides a framework to organise the 1s and 0s into human-understandable concepts.
Picking the correct data structure for a task is important, as it helps run things smoothly and saves you time from (re)inventing complex solutions to handle data.

In this issue, we're going to explore how data is stored and the 2 fundamental data structures that create the rest of the cohort - the ***array** and the **linked list.***

### Structured Bytes
Systems nowadays are usually 32 or 64-bit, meaning there are 32-64 individual 1s and 0s to represent each number and character we can imagine.

For simplicity in this article, we'll call each group of 32/64 bits a _memory cell._

To access a stored character or number, we’ll need a reference to their address in physical memory. 
This is a fundamental ability for computers, so performing this action is extremely quick because the computer knows exactly where to go to find the data.

Unfortunately, individual memory cells are quite limited in storage, and to reference anything bigger, we’ll need to group these cells together.
_Data structures_ are these memory cells stored together in a particular order so that they can solve real-world problems. 

## Contiguous Memory 
The easiest way to solve the storage problem is to have the neighbouring cells also be part of our data, 
so the computer can access them as a group. This allows us to store lists of numbers, words or full sentences and is what we would conventionally call an _**array**._

    width="718" height="404" 
    alt="A row of memory cells spelling PIZZA" 
    style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

Access is incredibly fast on any element in the list, as the computer knows how far along the address is from the reference point. 
This is why in code, when we want to get an element from an array, we also pass in the *offset* from that memory address.

    width="718" height="404"

_Note: The computer does do some smarts with variable length elements, as they also have to know the length of each element to be able to skip to the next element._

Inserting and removing elements from an array can be an issue though, as it takes many operations to make room or fill the hole made when inserting/deleting an element.

    width="718" height="404" 
    alt="Shows the issue of needing to move elements after a value is deleted inside an array" 
    style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

In the same vein if you need more space, extending an array can be difficult if there's not enough space in that register! 
The only way to do this is to _copy the entire array into a new area_ with a larger size.

    width="718" height="404" 
    alt="Shows an array expansion problem when there's no more room in the register" 
    style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

Arrays are very beneficial when needing to access and navigate memory cells due to their simple structure and isolated memory blocks.
However, more work is required when creating or modifying the array due to the need for contiguous memory and making room for new elements.
That is the trade-off we make for _**exceptional read performance**._

## Non-Contiguous Memory
The other way to store data is by _associating the next memory address after every element_ so that we always know where the next cell is. 
This similarly allows us to store lists of elements, but with different characteristics for access and modification. 
We call this data structure the _**linked list**._

<img src="/fundamental-view-data-structures/noncontiguous-cake.png" 
    width="718" height="404" 
    alt="Shows the word CAKE stored letter by letter in different cells in memory" 
    style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

This data structure allows memory to be stored in smaller chunks around the neighbourhood. 
Accessing a specific element in a linked list is a little harder, as we only have a reference to the starting element. 
A computer has to crawl through each element from the start until it finds the element it is looking for.

The benefit of this structure is that adding and removing elements is very easy once you have an element, as you can simply change where the memory addresses point to.

    width="718" height="404" 
    alt="Shows how easy it is to remove an element in the middle of CAKE" 
    style={{borderRadius:'15px'}} />

Similarly, if we need to extend the length of our linked list we can do so without much issue, we just add a reference to the new memory address at the end of the list. 
Linked lists don’t require a large set of contiguous memory to be set aside either, so copying arrays or element rejigging is ever needed to maintain the structure.

## Data Structures in the Wild

Data structures are simply ways we organise and store data, you may have seen other structures such as _**stacks**, **queues**, **dictionaries** and **trees**._ 
Under the hood, they are all combinations and specific implementations of _**arrays**_ and _**linked lists**_.

I encourage you to have a think how this is possible, can you recognise how other data structures implement themselves with only arrays and linked lists?
