title: Exception Handling in Kotlin
description: The use of exceptions vs. result types is a controversial topic that has sparked strong feelings on both sides of the fence. Kotlin's unique history has subtly shifted its developers to program a certain way. In this article we will discuss the history from which Kotlin was created and how the Kotlin team views exception handling in the language.

Kotlin is a modern programming language with its first stable release dating back to February 2016.
It began development in 2010 as developers found a need to build a language that was _concise, elegant and expressive, but also **interoperable with Java**_.

This lead to many design decisions that have shaped the way we program in Kotlin,
and with regard to the use of exceptions vs. result types, Kotlin has inherited the learnings, and baggage of Java exceptions.

In this article, we'll break down my thoughts and takeaways from [Kotlin and Exceptions by Roman Elizarov](https://elizarov.medium.com/kotlin-and-exceptions-8062f589d07), the project lead for Kotlin programming @ JetBrains.

## From the Ashes
When performing operations that may fail due to some external circumstance, _like interacting with files and the network,_
you would have to write code that checks the corresponding error condition and handle it.
This was a tedious effort that was easy to forget, and hard to debug.

Java's solution to this was to use checked exceptions, where every I/O operation is declared `IOException` in Java,
and the compiler checks that you either handle the exception or rethrow it.
This allows you to write exception handling code once for a bunch of I/O operations and allows the compiler to ensure developers don't forget to handle them.

### Problems
This worked for a while, but the problems accumulated over the years:
- Memory I/O APIs still declared `IOException` even though they never happened
- People abused checked exceptions in API design, leading to contagious lists of thrown exceptions
- Developers began routinely catching and ignoring exceptions to fit interfaces / API requirements

Perhaps the biggest killer for Java's philosophy to exceptions came in the evolution of how developers now solve software engineering problems.
Checked exceptions simply don't mix well with functional abstractions, nor compose well with higher order functions.  
Popular successor languages to Java, or even additions to Java's own collection framework _(streams and data-processing operators)_ excluded checked exception support, as it was too cumbersome to support.  
As Roman explains it:
> Checked exceptions are now widely accepted to be a language design dead-end.

This is the backdrop in which Kotlin was born into.

## Kotlin's Way
Kotlin inherited _Java's concept of exceptions_ and supports them seamlessly to interop with JVM libraries,
however, Kotlin exceptions are its own thing that comes with its own style of usage.
So how should Kotlin exceptions be used?

### Logical Errors
Exceptions should be used for failed pre-conditions and invariants in the system that the compiler can't catch.
As opposed to **exceptions for control flow**, _where you define expected exceptions and handling logic,_ 
these logical errors are for when the system logic doesn't make sense anymore _eg. index out of range or divide by zero error._ 

Roman elaborates:  
> As a rule of thumb, you should not be catching exceptions in general Kotlin code...
> Exceptions should be handled by some top-level framework code of your application to alert developers of the bugs in the code and to restart your application or its affected operation. 
> 
> Thatâ€™s the primary purpose of exceptions in Kotlin.

### Avoid Exceptions with Dual-use APIs
Kotlin's standard library is designed with null-safety in mind, much of its error handling interplays nicely with nulls.
For problems where it's less clear whether it's an input or a program logic error, Kotlin provides an API for both cases.  

Consider the following code:
```kotlin
// Input could come from user input or be a constant
val input = getInput() // "123"
val number = input.toInt()
```
If the input was the constant _**"123"**_ and it failed to parse, then that is a bug in the code and `input.toInt()` will throw a `NumberFormatException`. 
That is exactly what this function would do.
The idiomatic thing to resolve this issue in Java would be to wrap this function in a _try/catch_, but not in Kotlin.

What if the input came from a user? The context for where the data comes from matters, as a failure in this case would most likely be from a user error.
Kotlin provides a dedicated function _(or dual-use api)_ for this situation:
```kotlin
val number = input.toIntOrNull()
```
This code now indicates an error through its _result value (using null)_, which will play well with the rest of the Kotlin language.
For problems where there is a singular error condition for the operation, and you only care about a success or failure, then it is recommended to tend towards nulls over exceptions.

Roman elaborates:
> If there are multiple error conditions, then create a sealed class hierarchy to represent various results of your function. Kotlin has all those needs covered by design, including a powerful _when_ expression.

### Input/Output
Input and output operations represent a special problem where there's not necessarily any logic errors in the code,
but external conditions that the code has no control over, but must deal with.
Converting every I/O error into a special result will quickly get you back to the checked exceptions issue that we saw in Java.

The default stance is to use exceptions for input/output.
This way, you can write dense logic without worrying what each network call will produce.

Roman elaborates:
> Dedicate a single top-level place in your code to address all network errors uniformly.

Kotlin exceptions are not checked, so one can forget to implement this error handling producing logical errors that break applications.
These will get reported as bugs to developers, which is the stance the Kotlin team are okay with _(but you're very welcome to disagree)_.

## Building Applications the Kotlin Way (Opinion)
As a subscriber to [Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) _(though other architectures are completely fine)_, 
I think the model fits very well with Roman's recommendations:
- Exceptions should not be caught in general Kotlin code
- Exceptions should be handled by some top-level framework
- Use sealed class hierarchies to represent various result types (and enforce with `when` operator)
- Use exceptions for logic errors, type-safe results for everything else

With that in mind, I think the core domain should be pure with result types, pushing all I/O _(and thereby, exception handling)_ out to the _**ports and adapters**_.

The ports and adapters will all have their own top level handling of exceptions which will convert into result types for our domain, or separately handled for its use case _eg. 500 error for an API call_.

## Ergonomics
This article is already getting too long, but I felt the need to talk briefly about result types in Kotlin.
Personally, I don't feel like the standard Kotlin result types are suitable for creating pure and robust systems.
My main points of criticism are that:
1. Result type errors _**must**_ be throwable _(so basically, you have exceptions anyway)_
2. There is no actual enforcement to unravel result types, failure handling errors  will throw exceptions!

So  what should you use instead of the standard result types? _I'm not sure._  
Whether you roll your own or use third party libraries, I have not found a definitive solution to this problem yet.
