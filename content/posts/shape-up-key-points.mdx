Shape Up provides an alternative approach to project management designed for product focused software development teams. 
It brings a refreshing new take to handling common project management problems and provides very practical advice to implementing the methodology for different team sizes.

Below are the main ideas that shaped the teachings defined in the book, making us rethink some of our agile beliefs for product focused teams. 

## Appetites over estimates

When evaluating a new idea, we should ask how much time are we willing to spend pursuing this feature, rather than how long implementing the feature will take. 
We often get too excited discussing implementation details or committing resources to a thing that may not be valuable or will take far too long.

**_Good outcomes are relative_**, and the best outcomes are **_dependent on the time you have available_**. For example, if you are busy but starving in the city, the _best solution_ might be to order a 5 course meal at a fancy restaurant, but the _perfect solution_ would be to buy a hotdog from the stand across the street.  

A limit in timeframe changes the types of solutions we think of to solve the issue, and is more likely to resolve the core issue rather than imagined ones.
This goes against the agile method of having **fixed scope, variable time**, as shape up values the teams time (or appetite) over the scope - à la **fixed time, variable scope**.
It is most often worth asking how much time you are willing to commit to claim that potential value before you spend time planning and breaking down tasks.

## Bets over backlogs

Backlogs are a big weight that continuously decays in the background. 
Instead of constantly reviewing, pruning and removing old ideas - _focus on a handful of high quality, risk reduced bets for the cycle and **throw out the rest**._

The idea here is that _important ideas will come back to you_, committed stakeholders will track and refine their important ideas to bring back to the betting table each cycle on their own decentralised list.

The chances are the less valuable ideas will naturally remove themselves from betting table, removing backlog maintenance and keeping stakeholders engaged in the planning process.
A bug that happened once but never again will naturally disappear whereas a consistent (and valuable) issue will be brought up consistently by interested stakeholders.

## Projects over tasks
[![projects-over-tasks](./../shape-up/projects-over-tasks.png)](./../shape-up/projects-over-tasks.png)

Remove the role of the task master, who creates tasks up front and splits them among the development team.
Assigning developers individual tasks _reduces their context_ surrounding the project and the _ability for them to navigate around unexpected scope or design flaws._

Having connected tasks completed by different developers increases the risk of integration issues, as they _may not be aware of the implications of their design decisions_ in the the context of the project as a whole.

Developers work better when they have the whole project in view and _is able to work within the boundaries of the **project scope** rather than the **task scope**._ Developers practicing shape up can _**make their own tasks as needed**._ 

This shift in paradigm gives developers the ownership and freedom to adapt their solutions as they run into undiscovered scope, allowing them to quickly pivot within the cycle while also respecting the bounds of the project.

For example, when making a new UI component we may have a task to add a new button in a specific section of the webpage. 
This button takes up page real estate, and in our own testing we realise users will find it unintuitive to have the button in that area and worse, there's no space in that section on mobile!

A developer who given this ticket may just **_implement the ticket as best they can_**. After all, the design was set up front and you've got other tickets to do. 
However, a developer given the **_project of implementing the UI for users_** has the freedom to adjust the implementation, perhaps by putting the UI in a submenu, and still delivering the project scope (with a better UX).
